This software is available under two license models - "Qualifying" (the MIT with two extra bits)"
or Non Qualifying (NonQual). 

The difference between the two... 

If you are using this to further the profits or corporate, non-humanitarian, interests of Novo 
Nordisk (who doubled the cost of Novolin insulin that is required by some to maintain compatiblity 
with life), then you are bound by the the NonQual. Likewise would be a company like Mylan, for
the quintupling of the cost of epi-pen used to treat life threatening allergic reactions. Both 
of these had a personal impact for me.

If using this code (in source or object or derivative, etc) is contributing to or 
enabling predatory capitalism (unreasonable profit/extortion, or increasing the cost of life-
necessary products without other reasonable cause) like the aforementioned Novo and Mylan, you 
are bound to the NonQual. If people find your products to be valuable and are voluntarily purchasing 
them that is OK. Making money is OK. A windfall of continual profit is also OK. It's not OK when 
someone is being coerced into making the purchase or if they are required to do so and they are 
price gouged.

All others get the usual MIT license, for as long as they do not fall into the NonQual provisions.

As with everything in life, this part of the license is subject to change.

Non-Qualifying


You should probably just fuck off at this point because you cannot really use, copy, modify, or even 
look at this code without a taste of your own medicinee. If you fall into the requirements for this license, and are using any of the
software covered by it, an exception will be made if you provide non-conditioned financial
aid (and volunteer labor) to any non-affiliated third parties involved with any of the following efforts...
 - Ensures that every homeless person in the US will have a safe place to live and receive the medical care they need
 - Ensures that every US citizen, and those who's intention or desire is to become a citizen, has access to the same quality
 of food that you would feed your own family.
 - Closes down every animal kill shelter and opens enough no-kill shelters (with any necessary medical care, spay/neuter, etc)
 - anything else that has a net positive effect like these. 
 
 Using the software without also meeting these means that you will need to give me the sum that results in 10,000,000,000 USD after 
 taxes, every 5 years, so that I can use it toward the aforementioned efforts.
